      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) is a technology-based, no-stakes
diagnostic assessment system on academic and non-academic skills, with fast, actionable feedback.
Development and piloting of these assessments at two online colleges is underway. Preliminary validity
and reliability evidence of these assessments are reported in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to examine the effects and predictive power of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) on student success. DAACS is a no-stakes, open-source, formative assessment tool designed to measure newly enrolled college studentsâ€™ reading, writing, mathematics, and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, and provide them with feedback and resources to enhance their functioning and success. A randomized control trial was performed at two online colleges (n = 17,687) to measure the effects in terms of academic achievement and credit acquisition. Predictive power of DAACS on student success were also examined. Results highlights the importance of using DAACS as a suite of assessments and supports, and not as isolated components.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feedback on Writing for College Success: Machine Scoring of Essays on Self-Regulated Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes an ongoing project in which on-demand writing is used as part of a diagnostic evaluation of newly admitted college students. The authors will present preliminary evidence of the validity and reliability of human and machine scored essays and the usefulness of the feedback provided to students on their writing and their self-regulated learning. The purpose of the project, the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS), is to develop a no-stakes diagnostic assessment designed to help students transition to college. Research suggests that mindset, self-regulation, and grit are predictors of college success (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, &amp;amp; Kelly, 2007; Zimmerman &amp;amp; Schunk, 2011). DAACS provides feedback to students about their strengths and weaknesses in mathematics, reading, and writing, as well as their self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, and links students to appropriate resources and support. For the writing assessment, students write an essay reflecting on the results of a survey about their self-regulated learning skills. In addition to encouraging students to reflect on their SRL, the writing assessment provides feedback about their writing and directs them towards relevant writing resources. Although this approach is similar to Directed Self-Placement (Gere et al., 2010), DAACS is not intended to be used for placement; rather, it helps students determine whether they need support as writers. The scoring rubric developed for this assessment includes five criteria: content, organization, paragraphs, sentences, and conventions. An open source, automated program called Lightside was trained with hundreds of essays scored by human raters. Preliminary results indicate acceptable agreement between human and machine scores, and high rates of student and advisor satisfaction. These results and implications for uses of machine scoring of essays will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relationship Between Intraclass Correlation (ICC) and Percent Agreement</title>
      <link>/talk/2019-ncme-irrsim/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inter-rater reliability (IRR) is a critical component of establishing the reliability of measures when more than one rater is necessary. There are numerous IRR statistics available to researchers including percent rater agreement, Cohen&amp;rsquo;s Kappa, and several types of intraclass correlations (ICC). Several methodologists suggest using ICC over percent rater agreement (Hallgren, 2012; Koo &amp;amp; Li, 2016; McGraw &amp;amp; Wong, 1996; Shrout &amp;amp; Fleiss, 1979). However, the literature provides little guidance on the interpretation of ICC results. This article explores the relationship between ICC and percent rater agreement using simulations. Results suggest that ICC and percent rater agreement are highly correlated ($R^2 &amp;gt; 0.9$) for most designs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rethinking Placement Exams: The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills</title>
      <link>/talk/2018-innovations/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This session will introduce a new open source formative assessment developed as an alternative to tradition placement exams that measures self-regulated learning, reading, mathematics, and writing. Results from a pilot study conducted at two large online institutions will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) addresses the issues with traditional placement exams and remediation programs by providing students with immediate, detailed, formative feedback. In addition to assessing students in reading, writing, and mathematics, DAACS also assesses non-academic areas such as academic self-regulation, metacognition, strategy use, motivation, self-efficacy, grit, and test anxiety. Once students complete a DAACS assessment, they are directed to open education resources (OERs) to address any potential gaps in their academic skills while emphasizing their strengths. Student results are used by Student Success Coaches to inform targeted interventions based upon student&amp;rsquo;s individual feedback report and performance. Additionally, these data contribute to the College&amp;rsquo;s predictive analytics efforts with a goal of increasing the accuracy of predicting &amp;ldquo;at-risk&amp;rdquo; students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forum will introduce DAACS including the theoretical reasoning for this approach. Participants will have the opportunity to complete DAACS for themselves to review the assessments and feedback available to students (&lt;a href=&#34;https://demo.DAACS.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://demo.DAACS.net&lt;/a&gt;). An overview of training for Academic Advisors will also be provided. Results from a study conducted at two large online institutions will be provided which provide evidence of the psychometric qualities of the assessments and the impact on student success.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the issues of placement exams impact most less selective or open enrollment colleges, the efficacy of DAACS as an alternative to traditional placement exams was conducted at two large online distance education colleges: Excelsior College and Western Governors University. DAACS is an assessment framework that provides students with a formative view of their skills in self-regulation, reading, writing, and math. For administrators, DAACS provides valuable information to inform personalized interventions and more accurate risk modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will cover to aspects of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS): Instrument development the efficacy study. Results suggest that DAACS is a valid and reliable assessment of self-regulated learning, reading, mathematics, and writing. We will discuss the development process and psychometric qualities of these assessments. Part two will cover the efficacy study being conducted at two online institutions (Western Governors University and Excelsior College). Specifically, a large randomized control trial is being conducted (n &amp;gt; 10,000) to address the two research questions above. Preliminary results suggest there is no statistical difference in student outcomes, but there is a statistically significant increase in the accuracy of models predicting term-to-term retention (~ 5%). The implications for the null result to question one and the planned changes to the intervention will be discussed. It should be noted that some research suggest that placement exams and remediation programs have a negative effect on student retention and therefore a null result could be viewed as an improvement. However, follow-up analyses of the prediction models reveal important interactions between self-regulation domains and academic measures that will inform modifications to the intervention, specifically vis-Ã -vis targeted interventions, or nudges, for both students and academic advisors/mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The DAACS system assesses incoming college studentsâ€™ readiness in reading, writing, mathematics, and self-regulated learning. The purpose of this study is to examine validity and reliability evidence for the internal structure of the writing assessment. The evidence suggests that our conceptual framework holds for both human and machine scored essays.&lt;/p&gt;
