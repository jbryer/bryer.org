      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be teaching a short Introduction to Shiny as part of the Open Data Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Data Day is a collection of local gatherings of open government advocates, developers, programmers, statisticians, and citizens who want to build things with and promote the use of open data through project hacking. The next Open Data Day is March 3, 2018. The event welcomes participants from all backgrounds, interests, and skill sets with a common enthusiasm for transparency. In addition to project hacking, participants can learn about some of the tools in the open data toolkit by joining in the training workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Event website: &lt;a href=&#34;http://opendataalbany.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://opendataalbany.org/&lt;/a&gt;
Please RSVP Here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://opendatadayalbany.splashthat.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://opendatadayalbany.splashthat.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Development Of The Large Scale Diagnostic Assessments Of College Skills</title>
      <link>/talk/2017-nera/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) is a technology-based, no-stakes
diagnostic assessment system on academic and non-academic skills, with fast, actionable feedback.
Development and piloting of these assessments at two online colleges is underway. Preliminary validity
and reliability evidence of these assessments are reported in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rethinking Placement Exams: The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills</title>
      <link>/talk/2018-innovations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This session will introduce a new open source formative assessment developed as an alternative to tradition placement exams that measures self-regulated learning, reading, mathematics, and writing. Results from a pilot study conducted at two large online institutions will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) addresses the issues with traditional placement exams and remediation programs by providing students with immediate, detailed, formative feedback. In addition to assessing students in reading, writing, and mathematics, DAACS also assesses non-academic areas such as academic self-regulation, metacognition, strategy use, motivation, self-efficacy, grit, and test anxiety. Once students complete a DAACS assessment, they are directed to open education resources (OERs) to address any potential gaps in their academic skills while emphasizing their strengths. Student results are used by Student Success Coaches to inform targeted interventions based upon student&amp;rsquo;s individual feedback report and performance. Additionally, these data contribute to the College&amp;rsquo;s predictive analytics efforts with a goal of increasing the accuracy of predicting &amp;ldquo;at-risk&amp;rdquo; students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forum will introduce DAACS including the theoretical reasoning for this approach. Participants will have the opportunity to complete DAACS for themselves to review the assessments and feedback available to students (&lt;a href=&#34;https://demo.DAACS.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://demo.DAACS.net&lt;/a&gt;). An overview of training for Academic Advisors will also be provided. Results from a study conducted at two large online institutions will be provided which provide evidence of the psychometric qualities of the assessments and the impact on student success.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the issues of placement exams impact most less selective or open enrollment colleges, the efficacy of DAACS as an alternative to traditional placement exams was conducted at two large online distance education colleges: Excelsior College and Western Governors University. DAACS is an assessment framework that provides students with a formative view of their skills in self-regulation, reading, writing, and math. For administrators, DAACS provides valuable information to inform personalized interventions and more accurate risk modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will cover to aspects of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS): Instrument development the efficacy study. Results suggest that DAACS is a valid and reliable assessment of self-regulated learning, reading, mathematics, and writing. We will discuss the development process and psychometric qualities of these assessments. Part two will cover the efficacy study being conducted at two online institutions (Western Governors University and Excelsior College). Specifically, a large randomized control trial is being conducted (n &amp;gt; 10,000) to address the two research questions above. Preliminary results suggest there is no statistical difference in student outcomes, but there is a statistically significant increase in the accuracy of models predicting term-to-term retention (~ 5%). The implications for the null result to question one and the planned changes to the intervention will be discussed. It should be noted that some research suggest that placement exams and remediation programs have a negative effect on student retention and therefore a null result could be viewed as an improvement. However, follow-up analyses of the prediction models reveal important interactions between self-regulation domains and academic measures that will inform modifications to the intervention, specifically vis-Ã -vis targeted interventions, or nudges, for both students and academic advisors/mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
